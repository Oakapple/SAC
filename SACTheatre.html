                    <p class="lead">Each year, since 2011, the Scottish Arts Club has awarded a prize for the best Scottish Theatre production appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival during August.</p>

<p>The prize has become affectionately known as The Flying Artichoke, after the unique bronze sculpture presented to the winners as part of the awards ceremony.</p>

<p>Scottish-based theatre companies and productions with a Scottish writer, director or cast are eligible.</p>

<p>The judges for this award are all drawn from the Scottish theatre world.</p>

<p>A short list of productions is released during the Fringe and the winners are generally announced at the beginning of the final week, thereby giving SAC members the opportunity to see these productions before the Fringe closes.</p>

<p>An awards ceremony takes place in the Scottish Arts Club during the final week of the Fringe, at which the winners and runners-up are presented with their prizes.</p>

<p>You can get involved. Each year, ‘Spotters’ from the club are required to aid the process of viewing every one of the huge number of Scottish productions at the Fringe.</p>

<p>[This award was initially set up in 2011 in partnership with The Edinburgh Guide, who remained involved for the first four years. We are grateful for their help and advice during that period].</p>

<p>The Judges are proud of the fact that, over the years, they have spotted the potential in small and medium scale productions and that previous winners have all toured nationally and internationally.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Writers at SAC</h2>
                    <p class="lead">The Scottish Arts Club has an annual short story competition that is open to all writers worldwide aged over 16 years. We are delighted that celebrated author Alexander McCall Smith has again agreed to be the chairman of the judging panel. Those familiar with McCall Smith’s work will know that the historic Scottish Arts Club has often featured in his popular 44 Scotland Street novels.</p>
                    <p>The 2016 competition is now open to all writers worldwide aged over 16 years, published and unpublished. Stories entered for the competition should be 1,500 words or less and can be on any topic. The stories do not have to be associated with Scotland. Competition entries must not have been previously broadcast on radio, read aloud as part of a commercial performance or published in any format, including on a web site that is open to the public.</p>
					<p>Keep up to date with the progress of the competition, read previous winners or find out how to enter on the <a href="http://www.scottishartsclub.co.uk/shortstory2016.html">Short Story</a> page.</p>
					<h2 class="section-heading">Workshops for Writers</h2>
<p>The Scottish Arts Club also regularly offers two-day workshops for writers that are open to the public.

                    <h2>Join the Scottish Arts Club</h2>
                    <p>We have newly introduced an Arts Club Experience for potential Members. The offer is that you put £120 'behind the bar' which you can spend in the Club over the next 90 days. If you spend it all before the 90 days is up you can top it up. That way you can get to know the Club and we can get to know you. At the end of the 90 days or even before, if you decide to join we can easily facilitate your application (you will undoubtedly know people by then - we are a very friendly Club!) In the unlikely event that you choose not to join then any residue would be forfeited to the Club.</p>
                    <p>Please contact the Club (details above) for more information.</p>
