					<h2 class="section-heading">The Scottish Arts Club "Flying Artichoke" Award</h2>
					<p class="lead">Each year, since 2011, the Scottish Arts Club has awarded a prize for the best Scottish Theatre production appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival during August.</p>

					<p>The prize has become affectionately known as The Flying Artichoke, after the unique bronze sculpture presented to the winners as part of the awards ceremony.</p>

					<p>Scottish-based theatre companies and productions with a Scottish writer, director or cast are eligible.</p>

					<p>The judges for this award are all drawn from the Scottish theatre world.</p>

					<p>A short list of productions is released during the Fringe and the winners are generally announced at the beginning of the final week, thereby giving SAC members the opportunity to see these productions before the Fringe closes.</p>

					<p>An awards ceremony takes place in the Scottish Arts Club during the final week of the Fringe, at which the winners and runners-up are presented with their prizes.</p>

					<p>You can get involved. Each year, ‘Spotters’ from the club are required to aid the process of viewing every one of the huge number of Scottish productions at the Fringe.</p>

					<p>[This award was initially set up in 2011 in partnership with The Edinburgh Guide, who remained involved for the first four years. We are grateful for their help and advice during that period].</p>

					<p class="lead">This is the fifth year of the Award and once again the judging panel, who personally saw over 60 Scottish Theatre productions, were impressed by the evidence of both emerging and established talent within the Scottish Theatre scene and the overall

					<p>The Judges are proud of the fact that, over the years, they have spotted the potential in small and medium scale productions and that previous winners have all toured nationally and internationally.</p>
					<h3>Winner</h3>

					<h2 class="section-heading">2013</h2>
					<p class="lead">All three plays were supported with funding from the Scottish Government's "Made in Scotland" programme.</p>
					<h3>Winner</h3>
					<p><span class="showCS">HeLa</span>, written and performed by Adura Onashile, directed by Graham Eatough, produced by Iron Oxide, performed at Summerhall.</p>

					<p>HeLa, "is an all-consuming tale, spanning race and poverty in 1950s America to current ethical debates surrounding ownership of our DNA."</p>

<p>The panel of five judges, chaired by Catherine Robins,  said the play is "a fascinating insight into the interface between science and humanity." The play was originally commissioned by the Edinburgh International Science Festival.</p>

<p>The play was inspired by "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" by Rebecca Skloot, involving a cell sample taken by doctors from Henrietta without her permission which led to ground-breaking scientific discoveries -- and the question of who owns DNA.</p>

					<h3>Second Place</h3>
					<p><span class="showCS">If these spasms could speak</span>, written and performed by Robert Softley, directed by Sam Rowe, produced in association with The Arches, performed at Pleasance Courtyard.</p>
					<p>"an outstanding solo performance about disabled people's bodies, based on touching, surprising and hilarious stories". The judges said it was theatre "really breaking barriers".</p>
					<h3>Third Place</h3>
					<p><span class="showCS">Titus</span>, written by Jan Sobrie (English version by Oliver Emanuel), directed by Lu Kemp, produced by Macrobert Arts Centre, performed at Summerhall.</p>
					<p>The solo play concerns big lies and small truths, pigs that fall in love, crows that talk and other unlikely incidents. Director Lu Kemp also directed the first Flying Artichoke-winning play, <span class="showCS">A Thousand Paper Cranes</span>, in 2011.</p>

					<p class="lead">A thrilling production in a strong field.</p>
					<h3>Winner</h3>
					<p><span class="showCS">One Thousand Paper Cranes</span>, written by Abigail Doherty, directed by Lu Kemp, produced by Catherine Wheels, performed at Assembly George Square Gardens.</p>

					<p>The play is based on the true story of two young Japanese survivors of the Hiroshima bomb who try to earn a wish by making 1,000 paper cranes.</p>
<p>"A two hander with a good, taut script in which not a word was wasted. The performances were thoroughly, engaging, and on a number of levels, very moving.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful study of friendship with some entertaining and perceptive characterizations on the side. The actress playing the ambitious athlete, crippled in her prime by nuclear fallout, doubled magnificently as the paper crane making hospital orderly, her colleague striking just the right note as a matron and the stricken athlete's Mother.</p>
<p>Production of the first seven cranes had the audience enraptured, to be followed thrillingly by the strewing and garlanding of the stage with multi-coloured cranes, all crying and to save and celebrate life. The search throughout the auditorium for more paper to help to achieve the craved 1000 was as fun as it was enchanting.</p>
<p>This short show is truly original and of the shortlisted shows that I have seen, is the clear winner." - John Scott Moncrief</p>

					<p><span class="showCS">Ten Plagues</span>, written by Mark Ravenhill, music by Conor Mitchell, directed by Stewart Laing, performed at Traverse Theatre.</p>
